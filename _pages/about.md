I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at Saarland University, focusing on trustworthy multilingual natural language processing (NLP). My research explores cross-lingual generalization, interpretive variation, and bias in multilingual representations, emphasizing transparency, reliability, and inclusivity in language technologies.

I completed my PhD in Computational Linguistics at Saarland University and hold degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics. Outside of research, I enjoy reading comics, watching food shows, and traveling.
